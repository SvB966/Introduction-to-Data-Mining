# Extract the features and assigned cluster labels

# Calculate the Silhouette Score

# Calculate the Davies-Bouldin Index
davies_bouldin_avg = davies_bouldin_score(X, labels)

# Business Alignment Assessment
# -----------------------------

# Hypothetical score for relevance to business objectives
relevance_score = 8  # Represents high relevance to the project's goals.

# Hypothetical score for the model's insightfulness
insightfulness_score = 7  # Indicates valuable insights provided by the model.

# Interpretability and Understandability Assessment
# -----------------------------------------------

# Hypothetical score for the model's interpretability
interpretability_score = 7.5  # Indicates clear outcomes and insights.

# Hypothetical score for the model's understandability
understandability_score = 8  # Easily communicable to non-technical stakeholders.

# Stability and Robustness Assessment
# ------------------------------

# Hypothetical score for the model's stability

# Hypothetical score for the model's robustness
robustness_score = 6.5  # Moderate resilience to variations in data.
