Cluster Validity Evaluation:
Silhouette Score Calculation:
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score # Extracting the feature columns and the assigned cluster labels feature_columns = cluster_means.columns.tolist() X = global_food_security_index_df[feature_columns] labels = global_food_security_index_df['Cluster'] # Calculating the Silhouette Score silhouette_avg = silhouette_score(X, labels) silhouette_avg 
Davies-Bouldin Index Calculation:
pythonCopy code
from sklearn.metrics import davies_bouldin_score # Calculating the Davies-Bouldin Index davies_bouldin_avg = davies_bouldin_score(X, labels) davies_bouldin_avg 
Business Alignment Assessment:
Relevance to Business Objectives (Hypothetical Score):
# Scoring the Relevance to Business Objectives relevance_score = 8 # Hypothetical score indicating high relevance to the project's goals and business objectives. 
Insightfulness of the Model (Hypothetical Score):
# Scoring the Insightfulness of the Model insightfulness_score = 7 # Hypothetical score indicating the model provides valuable and useful insights. 
Interpretability and Understandability Assessment:
Interpretability of the Model (Hypothetical Score):
# Scoring the Interpretability of the Model interpretability_score = 7.5 # Hypothetical score indicating the modelâ€™s outcomes and insights are clear and explicit. 
Understandability of the Model (Hypothetical Score):
# Scoring the Understandability of the Model understandability_score = 8 # Hypothetical score indicating the results and insights are easily communicable and understandable by non-technical stakeholders. 
Stability and Robustness Assessment:
Stability of the Model (Hypothetical Score):
# Scoring the Stability of the Model stability_score = 7 # Hypothetical score indicating consistent and reliable results across different runs and variations in input data. 
Robustness of the Model (Hypothetical Score):
# Scoring the Robustness of the Model robustness_score = 6.5 # Hypothetical score indicating the model has moderate resi
